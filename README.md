## The Worst Random Number Generator made in ArnoldC
---
ArnoldC is a programming language based on the one liners of **Arnold Schwarzenegger**.

I randomly decided to make the worst pseudo-random number generator in arnoldC, I could've used some other language like C or C++, but nope I just wanted to punish myself lol.

I am the least smartest person out there so there is probably a better way to make something better. The goal was not to make the best pseudo-random number generator, just something that works and I think I have accomplished that.

This is one of the most interesting projects I have personally worked on.

I have provided the `.class` file so you that you can run it immediately by just doing:

```bash
java test
```

Or you can just straight up compile and run it again

```bash
java -jar ArnoldC.jar test.arnoldc
java test
```

This has taught me about how programs are able to generate pseudo-random numbers, especially how `rand()` and `srand()` work in C/C++.

Thank you,
